## Station Recognition Tips

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Troubleshooting" %}

**Station not working?** Check these common issues:

1. **Wrong block** - Make sure you're using the exact blocks listed
2. **Wrong pressure plate** - Each station uses a specific plate type
3. **Missing base** - Some stations need a specific block underneath (like fire under cauldron)
4. **Block above** - Make sure there's no block directly above the station

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Block Summary" %}

Quick reference for station components:

| Station | Top Block | Bottom Block |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Oven | Stone Pressure Plate | Smoker |
| Boiling Pot | Cauldron | Campfire/Fire |
| Mixing Bowl | Flower Pot | Stripped Log/Barrel |
| Cutting Board | Wood Pressure Plate | Stripped Log/Barrel |
| Frying Pan | Iron Pressure Plate | Furnace |

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Building Tips" %}

**Aesthetic ideas for your kitchen:**

- Group multiple stations together for a "professional kitchen" look
- Use slabs and stairs around stations as countertops
- Add item frames with ingredient items for decoration
- Use trapdoors as cabinet doors
- Place lanterns or sea lanterns for kitchen lighting

# ⚡ Quick Start

Let's cook your first meal in under 5 minutes! This guide will walk you through building a cooking station and making your first recipe.

***

## 🎯 Goal: Make Fried Eggs

We'll build a **Frying Pan** and cook some delicious fried eggs.

***

## Step 1: Gather Materials

You'll need these items:

| Item | Quantity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Furnace | 1 | Base block for frying pan |
| Iron Pressure Plate | 1 | The "pan" surface |
| Egg | 1-3 | Your first ingredient! |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Don't have eggs?** Find chickens nearby, or use `/hl give FRIED_EGG` if you're an operator to test!
{% endhint %}

***

## Step 2: Build the Frying Pan

1. **Place a Furnace** on the ground
2. **Place the Iron Pressure Plate** (Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate) on top of the furnace

That's it! When built correctly, the pressure plate becomes a functional cooking surface.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro Tip:** The furnace doesn't need fuel! The Frying Pan is a magical cooking station that works instantly.
{% endhint %}

***

## Step 3: Start Cooking!

1. **Right-click** the Iron Pressure Plate (your Frying Pan)
2. A cooking GUI will open
3. **Place 1-3 eggs** in the ingredient slots
4. Watch the cooking progress bar fill up
5. **Take your Fried Eggs** from the output slot!

```

│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Cooking takes time!** Fried eggs take about 3 seconds (60 ticks). More complex recipes take longer.
{% endhint %}

## Step 4: Enjoy Your Food!

Right-click while holding your Fried Eggs to eat them. Custom foods restore hunger and provide saturation just like vanilla food!

| Food | Hunger Restored | Saturation |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Fried Egg | 🍗🍗 (4) | ⭐⭐ (2.5) |
| Fried Eggs (2-3) | 🍗🍗🍗 (6) | ⭐⭐⭐ (4.0) |
